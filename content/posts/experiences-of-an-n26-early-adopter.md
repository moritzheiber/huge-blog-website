# Introduction
When I scour my email I can find the initial email I received from N26 (then still NUMBER26) in late March of 2015. That's when I, as a notorious early adopter, registered with their waiting list (yes, they had an initial waiting list for people to be on-boarded onto their new service), eagerly awaiting to be admitted entry to what was then rumored to become an actual alternative to the established banking behemoths. The excitement in the Berlin start-up scene, I remember, was palpable, because, at least for Germany, no other company had ever really taken on what many perceived as unthinkable: challenge the established money industrialists to provide a service that's fully designed for a modern, 21st century banking experience, including integration for personal mobile devices and all the comfort and commodities customers were already used to from their regular providers.

I won't lie, it took nearly 2 years after I joined in April of 2015 for N26 to become my provider of choice. I had been one of their earliest regulars customers, despite woes relating to backends(?), app issues(?) and even major security flaws(?). When they introduced their Black offering(?) I jumped on it as well, more driven by curiosity than actual interest in the features they were promising. The costs were manageable (in fact, compared to most other premium banking offerings they still are) and the added benefits, as well as supporting a young, thriving company, were something I didn't think about committing to for a long time.

The same process repeated itself when I first caught wind of their N26 Metal(?) upgrade, which somebody mentioned to me they were working some time in late October 2017. I received my invitation a few weeks later and signed up almost immediately, because the benefits actually sounded legitimately extraordinary for such a young product, especially when considering that they were also letting you benefits from all the goodies Mastercard's "World Elite(?)" program has to offer.

So overall, you could say I've been through the thick of it with NUMBER26/N26 in pretty much all of its customer focused services (and beyond). So why not write about it and share what I would perceive as leveled and good-willing criticism?

## Disclaimer

This article is going to contain a few bits and pieces that are, quite obviously, based upon my personal experience. I will try to find as many suitable sources and citations for what I'm going to be blabbering about as possible, but sometimes that's going to be hard, especially because some of it is just going to be my opinion, which in turn is simply based upon my experience with technology, its processes and my prior experience in working with it. So if you think a paragraph of this text is widely inappropriate or taken out of context please don't hesitate to contact me, I more than welcome constructive criticism and I will always consider your opinion.

# The Good

## The App

From the very beginning, N26's app has always been an outright pleasure to use. Its simple, unobtrusive design is something I wish any app would do these days, especially any other app of a competitor in the same field. It sets a resounding example for what is possible for modern banking applications and I absolutely love the way features, information and help content are arranged within it.

There are things in it I never would've taken for granted before I joined N26, among them effortless search, tagging of expenses, summary overviews, an ATM map, iMessage integration, PIN code and purpose ("You can withdrawn money with this card", "You can use this card overseas") management and numerous other highly enjoyable features. Whoever is in charge of app design and development at N26 is clearly worth their weight in gold (I'm kidding; but they deserve a lot praise at least).

I own an iPhone as a personal device and an Android phone for work, so I've also had the pleasure of using their app on both major mobile operating systems, and where usually either of the platforms gets the short end of the stick I can happily confirm this isn't case for N26's app. Functionality and design are absolutely on par.

If you like to have your bank with you in your (mobile phone) pocket there's hardly a better choice than N26.

## Instant notifications

Before I used N26 as my main provider of choice I never really had an idea what the balance on my account was at any given moment in time. Reading me bank statements was already a rather infrequent affair, although they were sent to me in the mail regularly they were all sitting on pile somewhere, and checking my balance online only happened when I really had to. There was a level of uncertainty I was never really comfortable with, yet, I was also too undisciplined and lazy to change anything about it. This took a wild turn the moment I used N26 more frequently.

I cannot begin to describe how valuable instant push notifications are in terms of awareness for your spending and oversight. In fact, it's invaluable! Even just for this feature I would be using N26 today. In most situations I find myself actively waiting for my phone to vibrate as soon as I've completed a cashless transaction, and the reassurance of my phone shuddering in my pocket is something that has become as much a part of my life as getting up in the morning or eating lunch.
