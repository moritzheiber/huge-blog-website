Hey there, my name is Moritz Heiber and I've been working as [a DevOps Birth Assistant at ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/profiles/moritz-heiber) since 2015. I love [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org), [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org), [Linux](https://linux.org) and all the things that come with them. I usually wrap my head around politics as well and I'm actively involved in promoting open source, diversity and inclusivity.
