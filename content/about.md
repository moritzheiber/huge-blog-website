![Gravatar](http://gravatar.com/avatar/df1b2052b604ebff52bbd10060199952) I'm Moritz Heiber and I'm the VP of Engineering at [ZenGuard](https://zenmate.com). I also work as an independent consultant on all things computer and Internet. I used to work at [Babbel.com](http://www.babbel.com) as their DevOps & Infrastructure Lead.

I love [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org), [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org), [Go](https://golang.org), [Chef](http://getchef.com), [CoreOS](https://coreos.com), [Docker](https://docker.com), [Linux](http://linux.org) and all the things that come with them. I usually wrap my head around politics as well and I'm actively involved in promoting open source, diversity and the spirit behind them.

## Stuff I use

* [i3wm](http://www.i3wm.org): Exceptionally simple and versatile [tiling window manager](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_window_manager). Beware: Once you use it every other way of interacting with a graphical user interfaces will seem inferior.
* [vim](http://vim.org): _The_ texteditor for pretty much anything. I might put up my `vimrc` at some point in time.
* [stringer](https://github.com/swanson/stringer): Extremely easy to set up (literally takes you 10 minutes to get it running with Heroku. At no cost.) Rails rss feed aggregator. Has a beautiful web interface and implements the [Fever](http://feedafever.com) API specifications (for using [Reeder](http://reederapp.com) or [Press](http://twentyfivesquares.com/press/)).
