It&amp;rsquo;s incredibly fast and flexible, has a unique template engine, and writing themes is really easy, should the slew of available themes not be to your liking. I decided to use it because it lets me get rid of all the dependencies Jekyll came with, it had a comprehensive preview mechanism (hugo server) and it allowed for a very narrow deployment pipeline to GitHub Pages, where this site is hosted at.</description></item></channel></rss>
